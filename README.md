# MalFinder™

MalFinder™ is a bot that can automatically scan the given links and files for malware using VirusTotal, making it easy and simple.

> [!WARNING]
> VirusTotal does not have 100% accuracy. False positives and false negatives can occur so always stay vigilant and cautious.

## Getting Started

This bot uses VirusTotal's API to scan your links or files automatically inside Discord. You heard it right! No longer do you need to leave Discord. Just send a link or file anywhere the bot can read messages and it'll start getting the scanned results to you as soon as it can. The bot will log all its scanned files, links, and errors into a file named log.txt and will print them out as well.

### Installing

You will need to host the bot as we do not provide hosting as of now. We recommend using a Linux self-hosted or cloud server. [Microsoft Azure](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/>) is a good way to start with 12 free months of hosting services.

Make sure you have Python >= 3.7.x installed before running this code. Copy and paste the code below in any bash-supported terminal environment. If you do not know what that is then just open your preferred terminal of choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MilitaryLotus30/MalFinderTM.git
cd MalFinderTM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, do the following:
1. Rename "config.json.txt" to "config.json" (on Windows, make sure to have file extensions shown!)
Here is how to show file extensions on Windows [10](<https://youtu.be/PoTah9YBG2Y>) and [11](<https://youtu.be/z5FBLAagPIc>)
2. Open "config.json" and input your values.

Then, you can start the bot via

```bash
python main.py
```

## Running the Tests

Simply send a link or file in any of the channels that the bot has access to and it will scan the files or website for malware and provide the scan results with the VirusTotal link of the scan.

### Sample Tests

If you're worried about downloading a file or clicking on a link, this bot can help you!
